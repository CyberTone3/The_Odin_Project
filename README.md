# Odin_Variables-Operators

Variables:
    Variables are like storage containers for data in code. There are three ways to create a variable: var, let, and const. 


Arithmetic Operators:
    A typical arithmentic operator operates on two numbers. The numbers can be literals, variables, or expressions.
Literals: let x = 100 + 34;
Variables: let x = a + b; 
Expressions: let x = (100 + 34) * a;
    FYI: The numbers are called the operands and the express between them is called the operator.

There are eight basic operators in JavaScript Arithmetic:
    + Addition
    - Subtraction
    * Multiplication 
    ** Exponentiation (raises the first operand to the power of the second operand. Ex. let x = 5, let z = x ** 2... is 25)
    / Division 
    % Modulus (Remainder)
    ++ Increment
    -- decrement 

Operator Proceedure:
Like in traditional mathmatics, when coding using arthimetic operators, Multiplication and division has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. An like school, the order of the proceedure can be manipulated but parentheses. 

Numbers:
    Numbers can be written with or without decimals. Extra large and extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponent) notation: Example, let x = 123e5; // 12300000, let y = 123e-5 // 0.00123.

Floating Precision:
